# Flask Documentation Translations

This repository contains the translation files for Flask. It is separate from
the Flask repository so that permissions and updates can be managed separately.

We use [Weblate] to manage translations. You'll need an account there. Then you
can use the UI to navigate to a language and find strings to translate.
