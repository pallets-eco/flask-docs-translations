msgid "Good applications and user interfaces are all about feedback.  If the user does not get enough feedback they will probably end up hating the application.  Flask provides a really simple way to give feedback to a user with the flashing system.  The flashing system basically makes it possible to record a message at the end of a request and access it next request and only next request.  This is usually combined with a layout template that does this. Note that browsers and sometimes web servers enforce a limit on cookie sizes. This means that flashing messages that are too large for session cookies causes message flashing to fail silently."
