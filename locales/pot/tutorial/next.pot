Compare your project to the :gh:`example project <examples/tutorial>`, which might look a bit different due to the step-by-step nature of the tutorial."

msgid "There's a lot more to Flask than what you've seen so far. Even so, you're now equipped to start developing your own web applications. Check out the :doc:`/quickstart` for an overview of what Flask can do, then dive into the docs to keep learning. Flask uses `Jinja`_, `Click`_, `Werkzeug`_, and `ItsDangerous`_ behind the scenes, and they all have their own documentation too. You'll also be interested in :doc:`/extensions` which make tasks like working with the database or validating form data easier and more powerful."
