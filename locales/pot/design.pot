msgid "A Python web application based on WSGI has to have one central callable object that implements the actual application.  In Flask this is an instance of the :class:`~flask.Flask` class.  Each Flask application has to create an instance of this class itself and pass it the name of the module, but why can't Flask do that itself?"

#: 8216a08714944a07bda7a11f2fdda1a6
msgid "There are three major reasons for this.  The most important one is that implicit application objects require that there may only be one instance at the time.  There are ways to fake multiple applications with a single application object, like maintaining a stack of applications, but this causes some problems I won't outline here in detail.  Now the question is: when does a microframework need more than one application at the same time?  A good example for this is unit testing.  When you want to test something it can be very helpful to create a minimal application to test specific behavior.  When the application object is deleted everything it allocated will be freed again."

#: ../../project/docs/design.rst:47
#: f18cba4c4f204a99bd01a0e50f0a1149
msgid "Another thing that becomes possible when you have an explicit object lying around in your code is that you can subclass the base class (:class:`~flask.Flask`) to alter specific behavior.  This would not be possible without hacks if the object were created ahead of time for you based on a class that is not exposed to you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../project/docs/design.rst:53
#: d4410e3fbc9c4039833c6b4853bfdc9e
msgid "But there is another very important reason why Flask depends on an explicit instantiation of that class: the package name.  Whenever you create a Flask instance you usually pass it `__name__` as package name. Flask depends on that information to properly load resources relative to your module.  With Python's outstanding support for reflection it can then access the package to figure out where the templates and static files are stored (see :meth:`~flask.Flask.open_resource`).  Now obviously there are frameworks around that do not need any configuration and will still be able to load templates relative to your application module.  But they have to use the current working directory for that, which is a very unreliable way to determine where the application is.  The current working directory is process-wide and if you are running multiple applications in one process (which could happen in a webserver without you knowing) the paths will be off.  Worse: many webservers do not set the working directory to the directory of your application but to the document root which does not have to be the same folder."

#: 50cd5d5d87ef4d51aa6179012552e46b
msgid "The third reason is \"explicit is better than implicit\".  That object is your WSGI application, you don't have to remember anything else.  If you want to apply a WSGI middleware, just wrap it and you're done (though there are better ways to do that so that you do not lose the reference to the application object :meth:`~flask.Flask.wsgi_app`)."

msgid "Flask uses the Werkzeug routing system which was designed to automatically order routes by complexity.  This means that you can declare routes in arbitrary order and they will still work as expected.  This is a requirement if you want to properly implement decorator based routing since decorators could be fired in undefined order when the application is split into multiple modules."

#: ../../project/docs/design.rst:90
#: 8798ec78492b49c1b09799863f6690f0
msgid "Another design decision with the Werkzeug routing system is that routes in Werkzeug try to ensure that URLs are unique.  Werkzeug will go quite far with that in that it will automatically redirect to a canonical URL if a route is ambiguous."

msgid "Flask decides on one template engine: Jinja2.  Why doesn't Flask have a pluggable template engine interface?  You can obviously use a different template engine, but Flask will still configure Jinja2 for you.  While that limitation that Jinja2 is *always* configured will probably go away, the decision to bundle one template engine and use that will not."

#: fd64f5479930423496b46e70cae0e414
msgid "But that's about where similarities end. Jinja2 for example has an extensive filter system, a certain way to do template inheritance, support for reusable blocks (macros) that can be used from inside templates and also from Python code, supports iterative template rendering, configurable syntax and more. On the other hand an engine like Genshi is based on XML stream evaluation, template inheritance by taking the availability of XPath into account and more. Mako on the other hand treats templates similar to Python modules."

msgid "“Micro” does not mean that your whole web application has to fit into a single Python file (although it certainly can), nor does it mean that Flask is lacking in functionality. The \"micro\" in microframework means Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Flask won't make many decisions for you, such as what database to use. Those decisions that it does make, such as what templating engine to use, are easy to change.  Everything else is up to you, so that Flask can be everything you need and nothing you don't."

#: df5213d28c8a476c865e479504b5e37a
msgid "By default, Flask does not include a database abstraction layer, form validation or anything else where different libraries already exist that can handle that. Instead, Flask supports extensions to add such functionality to your application as if it was implemented in Flask itself. Numerous extensions provide database integration, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and more. Flask may be \"micro\", but it's ready for production use on a variety of needs."

msgid "Why does Flask call itself a microframework and yet it depends on two libraries (namely Werkzeug and Jinja2).  Why shouldn't it?  If we look over to the Ruby side of web development there we have a protocol very similar to WSGI.  Just that it's called Rack there, but besides that it looks very much like a WSGI rendition for Ruby.  But nearly all applications in Ruby land do not work with Rack directly, but on top of a library with the same name.  This Rack library has two equivalents in Python: WebOb (formerly Paste) and Werkzeug.  Paste is still around but from my understanding it's sort of deprecated in favour of WebOb.  The development of WebOb and Werkzeug started side by side with similar ideas in mind: be a good implementation of WSGI for other applications to take advantage."

However Flask is just not designed for large applications or asynchronous servers.  Flask wants to make it quick and easy to write a traditional web application."

msgid "Flask supports ``async`` coroutines for view functions by executing the coroutine on a separate thread instead of using an event loop on the main thread as an async-first (ASGI) framework would. This is necessary for Flask to remain backwards compatible with extensions and code built before ``async`` was introduced into Python. This compromise introduces a performance cost compared with the ASGI frameworks, due to the overhead of the threads."
