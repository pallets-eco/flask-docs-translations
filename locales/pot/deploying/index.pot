msgid "After developing your application, you'll want to make it available publicly to other users. When you're developing locally, you're probably using the built-in development server, debugger, and reloader. These should not be used in production. Instead, you should use a dedicated WSGI server or hosting platform, some of which will be described here."

It is intended for use only during local development. It is not designed to be particularly secure, stable, or efficient.**"

There are many WSGI servers and HTTP servers, with many configuration possibilities. The pages below discuss the most common servers, and show the basics of running each one. The next section discusses platforms that can manage this for you."
