"You may want to make your HTML page dynamic, by changing data without "

"performing a redirect to re-render the template, you can add "
"`JavaScript`_ that calls |fetch|_ and replaces content on the page."

"|fetch|_ is the modern, built-in JavaScript solution to making requests "

"such as |XHR|_ or `jQuery`_. These are no longer needed in modern "
"browsers, although you may choose to use them or another library "
"depending on your application's requirements. These docs will only focus "

"It is important to understand the difference between templates and "
"JavaScript. Templates are rendered on the server, before the response is "
"sent to the user's browser. JavaScript runs in the user's browser, after "
"the template is rendered and sent. Therefore, it is impossible to use "
"JavaScript to affect how the Jinja template is rendered, but it is "
"possible to render data into the JavaScript that will run."

"To provide data to JavaScript when rendering the template, use the :func"
":`~jinja-filters.tojson` filter in a ``<script>`` block. This will "
"convert the data to a valid JavaScript object, and ensure that any unsafe"
" HTML characters are rendered safely. If you do not use the ``tojson`` "
"filter, you will get a ``SyntaxError`` in the browser console."
