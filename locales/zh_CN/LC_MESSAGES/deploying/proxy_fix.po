"HTTP servers should set ``X-Forwarded-`` headers to pass on the real "
"values to the application. The application can then be told to trust and "
"use those values by wrapping it with the "
":doc:`werkzeug:middleware/proxy_fix` middleware provided by Werkzeug."

"This middleware should only be used if the application is actually behind"
" a proxy, and should be configured with the number of proxies that are "
"chained in front of it. Not all proxies set all the headers. Since "
"incoming headers can be faked, you must set how many proxies are setting "
"each header so the middleware knows what to trust."
