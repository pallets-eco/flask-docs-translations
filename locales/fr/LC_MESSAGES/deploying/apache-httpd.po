"`Apache httpd`_ is a fast, production level HTTP server. When serving "
"your application with one of the WSGI servers listed in :doc:`index`, it "
"is often good or necessary to put a dedicated HTTP server in front of it."
" This \"reverse proxy\" can handle incoming requests, TLS, and other "
"security and performance concerns better than the WSGI server."
