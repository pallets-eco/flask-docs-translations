"`nginx`_ is a fast, production level HTTP server. When serving your "
"application with one of the WSGI servers listed in :doc:`index`, it is "
"often good or necessary to put a dedicated HTTP server in front of it. "
"This \"reverse proxy\" can handle incoming requests, TLS, and other "
"security and performance concerns better than the WSGI server."
